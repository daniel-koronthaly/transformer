This is an example of a transformer model, which is the same thing that powers LLMs. It is useful for sequence to sequence problems. This particular one generates phonemes from strings.

Examples:

| Word       | Phonetic Transcription        |
|------------|------------------------------|
| GEORGE     | JH AO1 R JH                  |
| HAPPILY    | HH AE1 P AH0 L IY0           |
| STRENGTH   | S T R EH1 NG TH              |
| SHARPENED  | SH AA1 R P AH0 N D           |
| CHILD      | CH AY1 L D                   |
